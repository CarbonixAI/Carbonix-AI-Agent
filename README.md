Project Overview
Carbonix AI is designed to monitor, track, and manage carbon emissions, providing actionable insights for emission reduction and carbon credit trading. The platform integrates with AI models that predict emissions and suggest optimization strategies. Additionally, blockchain technology is used to facilitate transparent and secure carbon credit transactions.

Key features include:

Carbon emission tracking and data analysis
Carbon credit marketplace powered by blockchain
AI-driven emission predictions and optimization
Secure, transparent, and auditable transaction history
Features
Carbon Emission Tracking: Track carbon emissions in real-time with detailed reports.
Emission Prediction: Use AI models to predict future emissions and suggest reduction strategies.
Carbon Credit Trading: Buy and sell carbon credits securely on the blockchain.
Sustainability Insights: Access actionable insights to reduce carbon footprints.
User Authentication: Secure login and registration with JWT-based authentication.
Data Visualization: Real-time data visualizations using D3.js.
Secure API: Expose secure APIs for interaction with both the frontend and AI model.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React, D3.js (for data visualization), Axios (for API communication)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, JWT (for authentication), Morgan (for logging)
AI: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn (for AI model and predictions)
Blockchain: Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.js
Database: (Optional) MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or any other preferred database
Hosting: AWS, Heroku, or similar for backend; Vercel, Netlify for frontend
Version Control: GitHub
Installation
To run Carbonix AI locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carbonix-ai.git
cd carbonix-ai
2. Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

bash
cd frontend
npm install
3. Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

bash
cd backend
npm install
4. Install AI Dependencies
Ensure Python dependencies are installed:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
You may need to train or download a pre-trained AI model as described in the AI section.

5. Run the Application
Frontend:
Start the React frontend:

bash
cd frontend
npm start
Backend:
Start the Node.js backend:

bash
cd backend
npm start
AI Service:
Run the AI prediction service (Python Flask):

bash
cd ai
python app.py
Usage
Frontend Interface: Once the application is running, visit http://localhost:3000 to interact with the Carbonix AI dashboard.
Backend API: The backend API will be available at http://localhost:5000. You can interact with it using RESTful HTTP requests.
Blockchain: Interact with the Ethereum smart contract (deployed on your Ethereum network) for carbon credit transactions.
API Documentation
Authentication
POST /api/register: Register a new user.
Request Body: { "username": "string", "password": "string" }
POST /api/login: Log in and get a JWT token.
Request Body: { "username": "string", "password": "string" }
Response: { "token": "string" }
Carbon Emission Data
GET /api/carbon-emissions: Get current carbon emissions data.
Response: { "totalEmissions": number, "reductionSuggestion": "string" }
Prediction
POST /api/predict-emission: Get AI-powered carbon emission prediction.
Request Body: { "features": [number, number, number] }
Response: { "prediction": number }
Blockchain Integration
Carbonix AI integrates blockchain technology for carbon credit management. The system includes smart contracts built using Solidity and is deployed on an Ethereum-compatible network.

Smart Contract Deployment
Compile and deploy the contract on an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Rinkeby).
The smart contract allows for issuing and transferring carbon credits.
Smart Contract Methods:

issueCarbonCredit(address to, uint256 amount): Issue carbon credits to a given address.
transferCarbonCredit(address to, uint256 amount): Transfer carbon credits between addresses.
getCarbonCredits(address owner): Check the carbon credits of a specific address.
